    <h1>Epoch: Through Fields of Everbloom</h1>
    
    <p>Some trees flourish, others die. Some cattle grow strong, while others are taken away by the wolves. Some men are born rich enough and dumb enough to enjoy their lives. There's no such thing as fair. You know that.</p>
    <p>We all make choices, but in the end? our choices makes us.</p>
    <p>It's ironic... How life has to be lived forward but only makes sense in reverse.</p>

    <!-- I wonder if using a <button> or <a href=""> would be a better choice
      for the button to start the game. We'll find out eventually. I'll probably
      use a placeholder for now which would be the button element -->
    <button>Are you ready to begin?</button>
